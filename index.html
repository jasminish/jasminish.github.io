				👋🏼 Hello there, I'm Jasmine!<br />
				I'm a software engineer with a need to tinker away at things and a curiosity for how things work.

		<p>
			I am currently a software engineering consultant at <a href="">ThoughtWorks</a>, where I help clients develop
			systems at scale. While I am a proficient full-stack developer, my interest lies in building, and learning more
			about, backend services.
		</p>
		<p>
			My past experiences include work at startups such as <a href="https://sleek.sg/">Sleek</a>, a startup based in
			Singapore that helps other companies start up, and <a href="https://www.fellowai.com/">Fellow Inc.</a>, a robotics
			startup in the SF Bay Area. Some cool things I've done:
			<ul>
				<li>Authored scripts for automated data extraction, processing, and migration</li>
				<li>Built web-based tools eg. dashboards and content management systems using frameworks such as Express /
					Django / ReactJS </li>
				<li>Developed a search feature using ElasticSearch to reduce product-search time and increase search
					reliability</li>
				<li>Built a new realtime discussions feature for user communication and file sharing using Django channels</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			Outside of work, I can be found with my nose buried in a sci-fi novel, dancing bachata, or hunting for the best
			brunch spot in town.
